# Godot Pixel Survivor

> Survivor-style game implemented in Godot 4 with GDScript (following Udemy series from Firebelly)

## Todo

- Change ability upgrade to use weighting (and min-level)
- Change enemy manager to use enemy weighting via configurable component (vs `WeightedTable`)
  - Consider using `Resources` for enemy type configuration (vs inline resources)
